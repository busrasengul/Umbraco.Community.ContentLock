### Fork
This is version of [CogWorks ContentGuard](https://github.com/thecogworks/Cogworks.ContentGuard) that is designed to work with Umbraco Bellissiama backoffice.
The team at CogWorks and the original developer [Marcin Zajkowski](https://github.com/mzajkowski) who worked on the original package when working at CogWorks has given their blessing for this community version to be updated for the modern version of Umbraco.
